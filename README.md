# CMM_Fixture
Purpose: Design fixture to assist CMM measurement of 7” circular part constrained from internal diameter to a 0.005” circularity
- Consulted stakeholders to identify and translate 14 explicit and implicit requirements into design parameters
- Collaborated with machinists to design for manufacturing (DFM) resulting in a 15% decrease in cost compared to the original fixture
- Ensured exactly constrained design and adjustable fixture to improve measurement accuracy and part measurement reliability within the 0.03” diameter range
